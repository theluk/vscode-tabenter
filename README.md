# TabEnter Leaderboard

Do you `Tab`+`Enter` all the time? Github Copilot might have changed your life. But do you know how many times you `Tab`+`Enter` in a day? This extension will help you track your `Tab`+`Enter` count and show you the leaderboard (coming soon).

## Features

![feature X](https://github.com/theluk/vscode-tabenter/blob/main/images/HumanVsCopilot.gif?raw=true)

### Track your `Tab`+`Enter` count

After installing the extension, you can **start** the recording
of your `Tab`+`Enter` count by running the command:

1. open your command palette (`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P`)
2. type **Start recording Tab+Enter count**

You can stop the recording by running the command:

1. open your command palette (`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P`)
2. type **Stop recording Tab+Enter count**

## Requirements

This extension makes only sense if you have Github Copilot installed.

## Known Issues

Because we do not have access to exact keystrokes, we are using a heuristic to detect `Tab`+`Enter` keystrokes. This heuristic is not perfect and might lead to false positives. If you find any false positives, please report them.

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 1.0.0
